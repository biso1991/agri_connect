# agri_connect
Agriculture Connect is an e-commerce platform that connects farmers and customers, making it easy to buy and sell agricultural products such as olive oil, livestock, seeds, and more. The goal of this project is to support local agriculture and make traditional products accessible online through a modern and easy-to-use marketplace.
